        <p class="project-body-text">In the late winter of 2023, DurmPAC began wondering how we could plant seeds for a blooming spring. We wanted to nurture art and community in our home city of Durham, so we devised a series of pop-ups dedicated to supplying artists and curating spaces and activities where new connections can thrive.</p>
        <p class="project-body-text">At our pop-up events, everyone is encouraged to grab a bag of art supplies, collaborate with new friends on a paper craft make-n-take activity, and connect with collective members as well as other attendees. We've partnered with local artists Eliza Redmann and Faith Reagin to enrich our events with hands-on activities, unique workshops, and fun artistic challenges suitable for all ages and ability levels.</p>
        <p class="project-body-text">DurmPAC: Supply Drop will be featured at select festivals, gallery exhibits, and cultural celebrations in Durham. You can look forward to seeing us at these spectacular events:</p>
